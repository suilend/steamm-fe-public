# Development Guidelines

## IPFS Development Guidelines

### Environment Setup
- Install and configure NFT.Storage client
- Set up environment variables for API keys
- Configure CORS for IPFS gateways
- Set up local IPFS node (optional)

### Best Practices
1. File Handling
   - Validate file types before upload
   - Implement client-side compression when appropriate
   - Use proper error handling for failed uploads
   - Implement retry logic for network issues

2. Metadata Management
   - Follow standard metadata schema
   - Validate metadata before upload
   - Include all required fields
   - Use proper versioning for metadata updates

3. Performance Optimization
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Use appropriate file chunking for large uploads
   - Optimize concurrent upload handling
   - Monitor upload performance metrics

4. Security Considerations
   - Never expose API keys in client-side code
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use rate limiting for uploads
   - Implement content verification

5. Error Handling
   - Provide clear user feedback
   - Log errors appropriately
   - Implement graceful fallbacks
   - Monitor upload success rates

### Code Organization
- Keep IPFS-related code modular
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Document all IPFS interactions

### Testing Guidelines
- Write comprehensive unit tests
- Test with various file types and sizes
- Simulate network conditions
- Test error scenarios thoroughly

### Deployment Considerations
- Use proper environment variables
- Monitor IPFS gateway status
- Implement proper logging
- Set up alerts for failures

### Documentation Requirements
- Document all IPFS-related functions
- Include example usage
- Document error scenarios
- Keep configuration details updated
