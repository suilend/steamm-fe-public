# Pool Launcher Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
A new feature allowing users to create Sui tokens and launch STEAMM liquidity pools in a streamlined process.

## Technical Prerequisites Review
‚úì Existing pool creation code reviewed in `/src/components/pool/PoolActionsCard.tsx` and `/src/components/admin/pools/CreatePoolCard.tsx`
‚úì Reusable form components identified:
  - `TextInput.tsx` for general text input
  - `PercentInput.tsx` for percentage inputs
  - `CoinInput.tsx` for token amount inputs
  - `SubmitButton.tsx` for form submission
  - `Parameter.tsx` for form field layout
  - `Dialog.tsx` for modals
‚ùå IPFS integration with NFT.Storage documented in architecture.md but not yet implemented
‚úì Navigation patterns consistent with existing routes
‚úì Mobile-friendly UI patterns implemented across all components
‚úì Direct entry to Pool creation with existing tokens implemented

## Technical Implementation Notes

### State Persistence Strategy
To implement the flexible entry points and session persistence:

1. **Token Creation State**
   - Store token creation progress in localStorage with a unique session ID
   - Save all form inputs after each step completion
   - Include created token data (token type, treasury cap ID) when available
   - Implement automatic cleanup of stale data (older than 24 hours)

2. **Direct Pool Creation Entry**
   - Add URL parameter support (e.g., `/launch?step=pool-creation`)
   - Implement token selector component showing user's wallet tokens
   - Filter tokens by those created by the user
   - Display token metadata (name, symbol, supply) in selection UI

3. **Recovery Flow**
   - Check for existing session data on page load
   - Allow users to resume from their last completed step
   - Provide option to start fresh if desired
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., token created but page closed before status shown)

4. **UX Considerations**
   - Clear visual indication of which step user is resuming from
   - Option to view newly created token details before proceeding to pool creation
   - Intuitive navigation between token creation and pool creation 

### Component Structure Updates
The feature now includes the following new components:

1. **Card Components for UI Consistency**
   - `Card`: Container with consistent styling for content sections
   - `CardHeader`: Header section with standardized spacing
   - `CardTitle`: Standardized title styling
   - `CardDescription`: Subtitle/description text with consistent styling
   - `CardContent`: Main content area with consistent padding
   - `CardFooter`: Footer section for action buttons

2. **Pool Creation Components**
   - `PoolCreationForm`: Wrapper component that applies Card styling to existing CreatePoolCard component
   - Maintains session data for token types created in previous steps

### Mobile UI Enhancements
The feature's mobile adaptations include:

1. **Responsive Token Selection**
   - Token selection components redesigned for touch-friendly interfaces
   - Optimized layout that stacks vertically on small screens
   - Condensed token information display for small screens

2. **Improved Parameter Controls**
   - Fee tier selection presented in a grid format on mobile
   - Touch-friendly buttons with appropriate sizing for mobile
   - Visual indicators to show selected options clearly

3. **Form Layout Adaptations**
   - Full-width inputs and controls on small screens
   - Reduced padding and spacing for mobile views
   - Stack controls vertically that appear side-by-side on desktop
