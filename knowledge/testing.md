# Testing Strategy

## IPFS Integration Testing

### Unit Tests

#### IPFSUploader Component
- Test file validation (size, type)
- Test progress reporting
- Test error handling
- Test URI generation
- Test metadata formatting

#### Mock Tests
- Mock NFT.Storage responses
- Test retry logic
- Test network error handling
- Test concurrent uploads

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end upload flow
- Metadata creation and storage
- Image upload and retrieval
- Error scenarios
- Performance under load

### Test Data
- Sample images of various sizes
- Invalid file types
- Malformed metadata
- Network simulation data

### Test Environment
- Mock NFT.Storage API for development
- Staging environment with real IPFS integration
- Production environment validation

### Performance Testing
- Upload speed benchmarks
- Concurrent upload handling
- Network latency simulation
- Resource usage monitoring

### Security Testing
- File type validation
- Size limit enforcement
- Rate limiting
- Content verification
- Access control

### Success Criteria
- All unit tests pass
- Integration tests complete successfully
- Performance meets benchmarks
- Security validations pass
- Error handling works as expected
