# Development Workflows

## Setup Process
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies with `bun install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
4. Configure environment variables
5. Run `bun run dev` for development

## Development Workflow
- Branch naming: `feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`
- Commit convention: Conventional Commits
- PR review process required
- Tests must pass before merge

## Feature Implementation Process
1. Planning Phase
   - Review existing components
   - Identify reusable parts
   - Plan component structure
   - Design state management

2. Implementation Phase
   - Create feature branch
   - Set up page routing
   - Implement components
   - Add blockchain integration
   - Write tests
   - Add documentation

3. Review Phase
   - Self-review checklist
   - Code cleanup
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation update
   - PR submission

## Key Commands
- `bun run dev`: Start development server
- `bun run build`: Production build
- `bun run start`: Start production server
- `bun run lint`: Run linting
- `bun run test`: Run tests

## Deployment Process
1. Merge to main branch
2. Automated CI/CD pipeline triggers
3. Build and test verification
4. Production deployment
5. Post-deployment verification

## Testing Guidelines
- Unit tests for utilities
- Integration tests for components
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Contract interaction tests
- Token operations testing

## Environment Management
- Development: Local environment
- Staging: Test network
- Production: Mainnet

## Debugging Tools
- Browser DevTools
- React DevTools
- Network monitoring
- Sentry error tracking
- Blockchain explorers

## Common Workflows
1. Adding new features:
